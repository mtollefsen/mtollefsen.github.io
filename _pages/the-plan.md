This is a list of milestones (almost exclusively career and education related) I set for myself. This helps motivate me, know that I'm on track towards larger goals, and helps get me a better idea of what my workload might be at different points in the future.

#### Spring 2022

#### Summer 2022

#### Fall 2022

#### Future
  These are milestones I know I want to hit but don't have a set date that they have to be achieved by.
  
#### Georgia Tech Master's in Computer Science with a concentration in Machine Learning
  List of all the classes I'm interested in taking.
