My name is Max Tollefsen and I'm a Data Scientist based in Houston, Texas. I have a bachelors in economics from the University of Houston with a minor in psychology. I've been interested in data analysis ever since I took Intro to Economic Analysis at U of H and I'm thankful that I've been able to use and sharpen that skillset in every job I've had. My long term goal is to build a deep competency in the data science space by studying more machine learning, more analytics techniques, and tackling increasingly difficult and interesting problems.
