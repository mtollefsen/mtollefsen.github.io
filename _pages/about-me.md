*Me and my sometimes loyal companion Loki*
{: style="text-align: center; font-size:0.8em;"}

My name is Max Tollefsen and I'm a Data Scientist based in Houston, Texas. I got my Bachelors in Economics with a minor in Psychology from the University of Houston and I'm currently working on my Masterâ€™s in Computer Science with a concentration in Machine Learning at Georgia Tech. You can see what I've been learning and follow my progress on my Master's degree [here](/masters-progress).

My long term career goal is to build a deep competency in the data science space by studying machine learning and analytics techniques and by taking on increasingly difficult and unique problems. My hope is that I continue to find opportunities to apply what I learn in the classroom to real world problems and that my work supports my desire to always be learning and improving.

Outside of work and school I greatly enjoy working out, reading, and training my Husky-mix Loki. Lately my workouts are centered around calisthenics movements and I hope to soon be able to do freestanding handstand push-ups, one arm handstands, and the side splits. My companion Loki, despite being a tripawd, has no problems with his mobility and can easily outrun me (and most people) on a whim.

If you have any questions or want to connect feel free to reach out to me at my email [max.tollefsen@gmail.com](mailto:max.tollefsen@gmail.com) or my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/max-tollefsen/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, cheers!
