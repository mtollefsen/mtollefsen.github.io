Me and my sometimes loyal companion Loki.

My name is Max Tollefsen and I'm a Data Scientist based in Houston, Texas. I have a bachelors in economics from the University of Houston with a minor in psychology. I've been interested in data analysis ever since I took Intro to Economic Analysis at U of H and I'm thankful that I've been able to use and sharpen that skillset in every job I've had. 

My long term goal is to build a deep competency in the data science space by studying more about machine learning and analytics techniques as well as by tackling increasingly difficult and interesting problems. In line with that goal, I'm currently focusing on college classes that will prepare me for when I apply to a master's program in computer science with a concentration in machine learning at the end of the summer. After getting my master's in computer science I plan to get a second, complimentary, master's in applied statistics, analytics, or a related field all while applying everything I've been learning towards solving real world and industry problems.

Outside of my career of choice I greatly enjoy working out and reading. I'm on a current kick of focusing on calisthenics exercises and hope to soon be able to do free standing handstand push-ups as well as one arm handstands. I also enjoy training my Husky-mix Loki. He's sharp but can be impatient at times. Despite being a tripawd his mobility is great and he can easily outrun me on a whim.
