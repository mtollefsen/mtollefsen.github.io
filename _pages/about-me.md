I'm a Data Scientist based in Houston, Texas. Currently I'm focusing on college classes that will prepare me for when I apply to master's programs in Computer Science with a concentration in Machine Learning at the end of summer.

For any questions, you can reach me at my email [max.tollefsen@gmail.com](mailto:max.tollefsen@gmail.com) or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/max-tollefsen/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.
