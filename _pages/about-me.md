*Me and my sometimes loyal companion Loki*
{: style="text-align: center; font-size:0.8em;"}

My name is Max Tollefsen and I'm a Data Scientist based in Houston, Texas. I have a bachelors in economics from the University of Houston with a minor in psychology and I'm currently working on a master's in computer science with a concentration in machine learning at Georgia Tech.

My long term career goal is to build a deep competency in the data science space by studying more machine learning and analytics techniques and by taking on increasingly difficult and unique problems. I plan to finish my master's in computer science and then pursue a second master's degree in analytics. My hope is that I find opportunities to apply what I learn in the classroom to real world problems and that my work supports my desire to continually learn and improve.

Outside of work and school I greatly enjoy working out, reading, and training my Husky-mix Loki. I'm on a current kick of focusing on calisthenics exercises and hope to soon be able to do freestanding handstand push-ups, one arm handstands, and the side splits. My companion Loki, despite being a tripawd, has no problems with his mobility and can easily outrun me (and most people) on a whim.

If you have any questions or want to connect feel free to reach out to me at my email [max.tollefsen@gmail.com](mailto:max.tollefsen@gmail.com) or my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/max-tollefsen/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, cheers!
