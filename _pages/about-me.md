Me and my sometimes loyal companion Loki.

My name is Max Tollefsen and I'm a Data Scientist based in Houston, Texas. I have a bachelors in economics from the University of Houston with a minor in psychology. I've been interested in data analysis ever since I took Intro to Economic Analysis at U of H and I'm thankful that I've been able to use and sharpen that skillset in every job I've had. 

My long term goal is to build a deep competency in the data science space by studying more about machine learning, more analytics techniques, and tackling increasingly difficult and interesting problems. In line with that goal, I'm currently focusing on college classes that will prepare me for when I apply to a master's program in computer science with a concentration in machine learning at the end of summer. After getting my masters in computer science I plan to get a second, complimentary, masters in applied statistics, analytics, or a related field and continue to develop my skills in machine learning and analytics.
