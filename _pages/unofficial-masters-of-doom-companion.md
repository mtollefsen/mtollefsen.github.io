This is an unofficial online companion to the book *[Masters of Doom: How Two Guys Created an Empire and Transformed Pop Culture](https://www.amazon.com/Masters-Doom-Created-Transformed-Culture/dp/0812972155){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}* (non-affiliate link) written by David Kushner. Below are links to different images, videos, and games in the order that they appear in the book. I loved reading this book and kept thinking how great it would be to have a single resource with links to all the crazy pieces of history that gets mentioned (e.g. Bill Gates in a trench coat with a shotgun) which is why I took the time to make this. I do not own or host any of the media linked here nor do I have any affiliate links on this page. Unless stated otherwise "the author" refers to the book's author David Kushner.{: style="text-align: left;"}

**Notice:** Some of the contents of Masters of Doom, and thus this companion page, is explicit.
