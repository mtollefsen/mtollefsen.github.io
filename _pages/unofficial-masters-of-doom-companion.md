This is an unofficial online companion to the book *[Masters of Doom: How Two Guys Created an Empire and Transformed Pop Culture](https://www.amazon.com/Masters-Doom-Created-Transformed-Culture/dp/0812972155)* (non-affiliate link) written by David Kushner. The book follows two of the founders of id Software, a company responsible for the creation of the cutting edge games Doom, Quake, and more. I personally loved this book and kept thinking how much I wanted a webpage I could consult that would have links to some of the images, games, and videos that the book references. I'm hoping this webpage will fill that niche. **Be aware that because some of the book's contents is explicit some of the contents of this companion is explicit as well.** As an additional disclaimer, I do not own or host any of the media that I link to on this webpage.
