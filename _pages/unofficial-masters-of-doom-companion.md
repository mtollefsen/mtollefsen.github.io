This is an unofficial online companion to the book *[Masters of Doom: How Two Guys Created an Empire and Transformed Pop Culture](https://www.amazon.com/Masters-Doom-Created-Transformed-Culture/dp/0812972155)* (non-affiliate link) written by David Kushner. Below are links to different images, videos, and games in the order that they're referenced in the book, organized by chapter and page. I loved reading the book and kept thinking how great it would be to have a single resource with links to all the crazy pieces of history that the book mentions (e.g. Bill Gates in a trench coat with a shotgun). Be aware that because some of the book's contents is explicit **some of the contents of this companion is explicit as well.** As an additional disclaimer, I do not own or host any of the media that I link here on this page.
