  Using data from the Overwatch League I created a Tableau dashboard of the 2018 Overwatch League rankings as well as a Tableau "story" analysing the grand finals.

  Using the data from the Overwatch League (OWL) that I [cleaned and organized](/overwatch-league-data-cleanup/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} I created a [Tableau dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/max.tollefsen/viz/OverwatchLeague2018/OWL2018Dashboard){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} with two tabs centered around the 2018 OWL season. The first tab shows a dashboard of the rankings of every team through all four stages of the 2018 season and includes each teams' average matches and games won per stage. There is also a comparison of each teams' starting and ending rank. Clicking any element of the dashbaord will highlight every element that belongs to the same team as the element that was clicked (see example below). Holding control while clicking elements will allow you to highlight multiple elements (and thus teams).

  The second tab uses Tableau's "story" feature to walk the viewer through an exploratory analysis of the 2018 OWL data, providing background on the prevailing strategy at the time, gleaming insights from the stats, and posing interesting questions worthy of further investigation.
  
  To more authentically represent the OWL and Overwatch brand I manually added custom colors into Tableau that matched every OWL team's and every Overwatch hero's color scheme. Similarly, I also downloaded and manually added every OWL team's logo and every Overwatch hero's icon into Tableau.
