### [Overwatch League Data Cleanup](https://github.com/maxtoll/Overwatch-League-Data/tree/main/Data%20Cleanup)

### [The Assault on Assault - An Analysis of Overwatch's Most Despised Game Mode](https://nbviewer.org/github/mtollefsen/overwatch-league-data-projects/blob/main/Notebooks/The%20Assault%20on%20Assault.ipynb){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
(If you click the link, please give it a minute to load). Notebook going over Overwatch's Assault game mode, why it's so hated, how its influencing Overwatch's design, and what's going to happen to it in the future. I use analytical SQL queries to support my writing as well as the conclusions I draw. Marvel Comic's Juggernaut also lends a hand in helping illustrate my points.
