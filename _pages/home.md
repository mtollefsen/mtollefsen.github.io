My name is Max and welcome to my website. I'm a Data Scientist by trade and am currently based in Houston, Texas (although I'm always open to an adventure in a new city!). Currently I'm focusing on college classes that will prepare me for when I apply to a master's program in Computer Science with a concentration in Machine Learning at the end of summer. After getting my masters in computer science I plan to get a second, complimentary, masters in applied statistics, analytics, or a related field and continue to develop my skills in machine learning and analytics. 

Please use the links at the top of the page to navigate my website and look at my portfolio. Also feel free to reach out to me at my email [max.tollefsen@gmail.com](mailto:max.tollefsen@gmail.com) or my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/max-tollefsen/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} if you have any questions or want to connect.
