Hello! My name is [Max](/about-me/) and welcome to my website where I host my portfolio. I'm a Data Scientist and I'm a Computer Science master's student at Georgia Tech. Houston, Texas is where Iâ€™m currently based but I'm always open to an adventure in a new city.

If you have any questions or want to connect feel free to reach out to me at my email [max.tollefsen@gmail.com](mailto:max.tollefsen@gmail.com) or my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/max-tollefsen/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, cheers!
