## Overview

Bayesian statistics is built on Bayes' Formula:

$$ \pi(\theta | X) = \dfrac{f(X|\theta) \cdot \pi(\theta)}{m(X)}  \hspace{10pt} OR \hspace{10pt}  Posterior = \dfrac{Likelihood \cdot Prior}{Marginal} $$

This is a way to estimate the distribution of one or more parameters given some data $X$.
