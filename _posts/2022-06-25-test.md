TOOLS:
- SQL

BRIEF:
  I used SQL to clean 4,958,301 rows of data from the Overwatch League and organized the data into an SQL database that was connected, easy to access, and immediately ready for use.
  
VERBOSE:
  I took data from [the Overwatch League website](https://overwatchleague.com/en-us/statslab){} and uploaded it to my SQLite database. This was 4,958,301 rows of data from 14 flat CSV files. Some of the challenges with this data included:
  - Spelling errors
  - Inconsistent formatting
  - Incorrect values
  - Missing values
  - Duplicate rows
  - Outdated names
  - Lack of overarching organizational structure

  After transforming the data with SQL code you can find on my GitHub [here](https://github.com/mtollefsen/overwatch-league-data-projects/tree/main/Data%20Cleanup){} the results were a connected database of 7 tables (pictured below) in first normal form.

  I fixed all of the above listed problems and further enhanced the data by adding:
  - primary and foreign keys
  - constraints
  - data on all of Overwatch's current heroes (the `hero` table in the above image)
