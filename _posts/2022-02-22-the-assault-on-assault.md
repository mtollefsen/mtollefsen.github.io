  I wrote an article-like Jupyter notebook showing why Overwatch's Assault is a heavily disliked game mode, what the Overwatch development team is doing about it, and what I think should be done, using data from the Overwatch League to support my points.

  Using the data from the Overwatch League (OWL) that I [cleaned and organized](/overwatch-league-data-cleanup/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} I made a [Jupyter notebook](https://nbviewer.org/github/mtollefsen/overwatch-league-data-projects/blob/main/Notebooks/The%20Assault%20on%20Assault.ipynb){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} (if you click the link please give it a minute to load) that explains some of the reasons the Assault game mode in Overwatch is despised by many, explains the actions that the Overwatch development team is taking to remedy this, and goes over what I personally think should be done. I use SQL queries (with the help of Python as SQL is not natively integrated in Jupyter Notebook) to support my points. I also utilize GIFs of Marvel Comic's Juggernaut to add some flair and to further illustrate the points I'm making.
